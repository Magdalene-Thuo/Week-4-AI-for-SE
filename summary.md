Using AI-powered testing tools like Testim.io enhances coverage and reliability by automatically identifying UI elements and generating test cases through intelligent suggestions. Manual testing often misses regression bugs due to human error or limited repetition, but AI tools ensure consistency.In this test, we validated both successful and failed login scenarios using AI-assisted selectors and automated flows. The test scripts generated with AI took less time to configure, handled dynamic selectors, and offered better error traceability.Overall, AI testing improves speed, reduces effort in writing and maintaining scripts, and adapts better to UI changes â€” something that traditional, hardcoded Selenium tests struggle with.
