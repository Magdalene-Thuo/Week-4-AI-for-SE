Both implementations achieve the same functionality — sorting a list of dictionaries by a specified key. The Copilot-suggested code is syntactically clean and almost identical to the manual version. This suggests that GitHub Copilot is learning and predicting code that closely mimics efficient human writing patterns.In terms of performance, both use Python’s built-in sorted() function with a lambda function as the key. Time complexity is O(n log n) for both. There is no computational efficiency difference, but the Copilot version slightly improves developer productivity by reducing thinking and typing time.AI tools like Copilot significantly accelerate development, especially for boilerplate or repetitive code. In real-world projects, this reduces context-switching and helps developers focus on logic over syntax. However, developers must still review and test AI-generated code for bugs, edge cases, and data type handling.
